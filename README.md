### What I learned

I learned how to center div vertically and horizontally.

```SCSS
.container {
  background: #ffffff;
  width: 25%;
  border-radius: 16px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  padding: 14px;
}
```

I want to focus on Tailwind css and React js by building projects with it.
